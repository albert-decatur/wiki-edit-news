# wiki-edit-news

Unofficial twitter bot that posts [DBpedia events](http://dbpediawww.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/events) based on newsworthy Wikipedia edits.
Almost all the work done by DBpedia in prepping these events and their descriptions!
Updates when DBpedia events are updated - can be spotty for now but it's a new service.
